Q1

DHKE is built such that we can perform key exchange over a public channel.
However RSA is the more popular alternative for this purpose. We do not need
a secure channel since it is hard for an attacker to guess the values of a
and b and solve the discrete log problem, something which is not possible at
the moment without expensive computing power and lots of time.

Q2

Advantage: Good against passive eavesdroppers as it is costly to solve the
discrete log algorithm. This makes it a good solution to the problem of key
establishment.

Disadvantage: Vulnerable to MITM attack since reciever is not verified. Additionally
if primes are not chosen properly , the generator will only have a small group
which might make it susceptible to brute force attacks.

Q3

At 50 bits, cracking the key takes about 5 minutes. Since the time complexity
is O(2^(n/2)), and extrapolating from the data from my machine, we can see that
a value of 140 bits would take 18.61 billion years to crack. A higher value of
512 bits would prevent cracking the key by even the most powerful supercomputers.
